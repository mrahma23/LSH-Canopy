% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides

%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:

\usepackage{romannum}


\usepackage{algorithm}
\usepackage[algo2e]{algorithm2e}
% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or

% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most

% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.



%\usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later 
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}

% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/



%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version can be obtained at:

% Read the url.sty source comments for usage information. Basically,
% \url{my_url_here}.





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.

\begin{abstract}
	
The advancement in genome technologies has allowed for the 
collective sequencing of co-existing microbial communities (Metagenomics), omnipresent 
across various environments like the soil, ocean and human body.
%
Metagenomics has 
spurred the development of several 
bioinformatics approaches for analyzing 
the diversity, abundance, function and role of the 
different organisms 
within these communities. 
%
As an example,  metagenomics allows for the analysis 
of the pathogenic role played by the microbial organisms within the 
human host and has implications for betterment of health and drug discovery. 


We present 
an approximate  but fast 
clustering algorithm
for analyzing 
large-scale metagenomic data. Our approach 
achieves efficiency 
by first partitioning the large number of sequence reads into 
groups (called canopies) using a fast locality sensitive hashing based 
distance function. This 
initial approximate assignment of reads to 
canopies is refined by using 
state-of-the-art
sequence clustering algorithms. This
two-phase 
approach allows for the
use  of 
our developed algorithms as a pre-processing phase for computationally expensive 
clustering 
algorithms. Using the clusters as surrogates for 
Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) we 
can estimate  the biodiversity within 
a community sample.

The Canopy-based clustering algorithm is evaluated on synthetic and real 
world 16S 
metagenome  benchmarks. We demonstrate the ability 
of our proposed approach to  
determine meaningful OTU assignments and observe
significant speedup with regards 
to run time when combined with three 
different state-of-the-art sequence clustering algorithms.

\section{Introduction}
\label{intro}

% Microorganism and it's Importance + what is metagenome
% HR Editing [Nice work Mohammad]

A large portion of the  earth's biomass comprises trillions of tiny  microorganisms with varying  biodiversity and play a crucial role in ensuring the stability of environment. Communities of interacting microbes  exists in several ecosystems varying from the soil, ocean and human body \cite{MARHumanMicro}; and though, most of them are beneficial to the host some are known to cause unwanted conditions and can be linked to cause of diseases in the host \cite{MARTurnbaugh}. 

\emph{Metagenomics} is the sequencing of the collective DNA  of microbial organisms coexisting as communities. Analyzing metagenomes has provided an unprecedented opportunity to understand the diversity, role and function of these organisms within clinical and ecological environments \cite{MARHumanGut}\cite{MARMihaiPop}.

% What is read + 16S/18S + OTU + OTU-Clustering 


State-of-the-art genome sequencing technologies do not deliver the complete genome of an organism (millions in length), but large number of short contiguous subsequences called \emph{reads} of length 75 to 500 (based on technology) in random order. Sequencing communities of genomes exacerbates the problem since reads from different microbes are mixed together and upfront  the composition of a community in terms of abundance and identity of bacteria is unknown \cite{MARMetaChallenge}. Further, sequencing technologies produce datasets that range from Gigabytes (GB) to Terabytes (TB) with their own idiosyncrasies.  Alternatively, targeted metagenome sequencing  that involves sequencing of \emph{marker genes} has been popular for the characterization of these communities. 16S and 18S sequences are repetitive marker genes within microbial genomes but have variations in their sequences that allow them to be separated into different taxonomic groups \cite{MAR16S}. 


Over the years, several unsupervised clustering algorithms have been developed and used for the analysis of large-scale targeted and whole metagenome sequences (reviewed in Section \ref{sec:Literature}). The unsupervised grouping  of similar sequences from the 16S/18S genes is referred as \emph{binning} and allows for the estimation of biodiversity within a sample. Binning leads to assignment of similar sequences within groups called \emph{Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs)} \cite{MAROTU}. Microbial OTUs are generally ecologically consistent across the hosts regardless of OTU clustering approaches \cite{MAROTUConsistant}. 

% What have we done and how it is better

In this paper we develop an approximate but efficient clustering algorithm based on Canopy Clustering \cite{MARCanopy} which can be used as a pre-clustering  step with any state-of-the-art sequence clustering algorithms. Specifically, our approach identifies canopies with a greedy procedure and a fast sequence distance metric based on locality sensitive hashing \cite{MARLshRef2}. Sequences within the canopies are considered as an initial partition (or grouping) of data which can be further refined by applying expensive and accurate clustering algorithms. Our developed approach treats each canopies independently allowing for easy parallelization.

We present experimental results on real and synthetic metagenome sequence benchmarks and show that use of Canopy Clustering (CC) in combination with UCLUST \cite{MARuclust}, SWARM \cite{MARSwarm2}, SUMACLUST \cite{MARSumaclust} and Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) based clustering leads to improved run time efficiency with accurate clustering results. We also show the performance of our developed approach is scalable for large datasets with increased number of processors. The source code is freely available on Github\footnote{https://github.com/mrahma23/LSH-Canopy} for public use. 
          

\section{Literature Review}
\label{sec:Literature}

Over the years several sequence clustering methods have been developed and used widely for metagenome sequences. A comprehensive survey by Kopylova et. al. \cite{MARopenDeNovo} benchmarks various sequence clustering algorithms  including UCLUST \cite{MARuclust}, SWARM \cite{MARSwarm2}, SUMACLUST \cite{MARSumaclust} and MOTHUR \cite{MARMothur}

CD-HIT \cite{MARCDhit} is general purpose sequence clustering algorithm that follows an incremental, greedy approach. CD-HIT uses pairwise sequence alignment to find similar sequences. UCLUST \cite{MARuclust} is similar to CD-HIT but achieves a significant speedup over CD-HIT by using seeds (fixed length gapless subsequences) for performing pairwise sequence comparisons. MC-LSH \cite{MARMetaLSH} utilizes an efficient locality sensitive based hashing function to approximate the pairwise sequence similarity. MC-MinH \cite{MARMcMinH} uses min-wise \cite{MARMinWise} hashing along with the greedy clustering to group 16S and whole metagenome sequences. Mash \cite{MAROtherMinH}, uses MinHash locality sensitive hashing to reduce large sequences to a representative sketch and estimate pairwise distances. Other methods for clustering sequence reads include TOSS \cite{MARToss}, AbundanceBin \cite{MARAbundant} and CompostBin \cite{MARCompost}. All unique kmers are first grouped in TOSS and then clusters are merged based on kmer repetitions. In AbundanceBin, reads are modeled as a mixture of Poisson distributions. Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm is used to infer model parameters for the final clustering. Principal component analysis is used within CompostBin to project the data into a lower dimensional space, followed with a graph partitioning approach. MOTHUR \cite{MARMothur} uses a pairwise distance matrix as input and performs hierarchical clustering. An expensive sequence alignment is used between all pairs of input sequences for computing distances.

SWARM \cite{MARSwarm2} uses exhaustive single-linkage clustering based on optimal sequence alignment. Sequences that are less than a certain distance from any other other sequence in the cluster are clustered together. SWARM attempts to reduce the impact of clustering parameters on the resulting OTUs by avoiding arbitrary global clustering thresholds and input sequence ordering dependence. At first SWARM builds an initial set of OTUs is constructed by iteratively agglomerating similar amplicons. Then amplicon abundance values are used to reveal OTUs’ internal structures and to break them into sub-OTUs.

SUMACLUST \cite{MARSumaclust} follows similar approach as UCLUST. Based on greedy strategy SUMACLUST incrementally constructs clusters by comparing an abundance-ordered list of input sequences against the representative set of already-chosen sequences. Initially this list is empty. UCLUST and recently developed, SWARM and SUMACLUST are considered to be the state-of-the-art metagenome sequence clustering methods by a benchmarking study \cite{MARopenDeNovo}. 

In this study we developed an approximate but highly efficient sequence clustering algorithm  using Canopies \cite{MARCanopy}. The developed approach can be used as a pre-processing step for other state-of-art sequence clustering algorithms to improve efficiency and also retains correctness in clustering.

\section{Methods}
\label{sec:Methods}
\subsection{\textbf{Overview}}

Figure \ref{fig:flowchart} shows an overview of our proposed canopy clustering approach for metagenome sequences. Sequence reads are represented with \textit{kmers} defined as contiguous subsequence of length k. We select a read randomly as the canopy centroid. Then we compute the distances of other reads to this canopy centroid. Two thresholds are used in Canopy clustering algorithm. If the a distance is less than a \emph{tight} threshold ($T2$) we assign the read to the canopy and that read will not be considered for another canopy. Otherwise, if a distance is less than a \emph{soft} threshold ($T1$) we assign the read to the canopy but that read will be available for another canopy. This process continues until all sequence reads is assigned to at least one canopy. For fast canopy assignment we use a random projection based technique. Specifically, we use Locality Sensitive Hash (LSH) to compute pairwise distances. More accurate clustering methods are used to sub-cluster each canopy in parallel. Sub-clustering method considers only the members within the canopy which reduces pairwise distance calculations. In this study UCLUST, SUMACLUST, SWARM and Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) based clustering are used as more accurate sub-clustering methods for canopies which are briefly discussed in Section \ref{sub-cluster}.

\subsection{\textbf{Canopy Clustering}}

Canopy Clustering \cite{MARCanopy} is an efficient approximate clustering algorithm often used as pre-processing step for other accurate and expensive clustering methods like the K-means algorithm or the Hierarchical clustering algorithm. It is intended to speed up clustering operations on large data sets, where standard clustering algorithms may be impractical in terms of run time and memory consumption due to the large number of pairwise distance calculations. For a dataset with $N$ instances, worst case calculations without canopy clustering is $N^2$. After canopy clustering, if the number of canopies is $k$ then worst case calculations with canopy clustering is $\sum_{i=1}^{k}(c_i)^2$ where $c_i$ is the number of instances within $i$th canopy.

Canopy clustering uses two distance thresholds, (\romannum{1}) \textit{soft} threshold $T1$ and (\romannum{2}) \textit{tight} threshold $T2$. If data point $p_1$ is within the soft distance threshold $T1$ with centroid $p_2$ then $p_1$ will reside in same canopy as $p_2$ but $p_1$ may belong to other canopies assuming that it has only met soft threshold and best match is yet to be found. Thus one data point may belong to multiple canopies in Canopy clustering. On the other hand if data point $p_1$ is within the tight distance threshold $T2$ with centroid $p_2$ then canopy clustering assigns $p_1$ to the same canopy as $p_2$ and stops assigning $p_1$ to any other canopy assuming that tight threshold has been met and best canopy assignment for $p_1$ has been found. Canopy centrists are selected randomly until all data points is assigned to at least one canopy. 


\subsection{\textbf{Locality Sensitive Hashing}}

Canopies are intended to reduce pairwise distance calculations. Canopy clustering itself should be efficient which requires a fast and approximate distance measure for Canopy assignments. Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) \cite{MARLshRef2} is an algorithm for solving the approximate or exact near neighbors search. Suppose we have a space S of points with a distance measure $d(x,y)$. A family H of hash functions is said to be $(d1, d2, p1, p2)$-sensitive for any x and y in S: if $d(x, y)<d1$, then the probability over all $h\in{H}$, that $h(x)=h(y)$ is at least $p1$ and if $d(x, y)>d2$ , then the probability over all $h\in{H}$, that $h(x)=h(y)$ is at most $p2$. LSH provides a fast approximate distance measure while reducing data dimensionality which makes LSH appropriate for Canopy clustering in 16S and metagenomic data.


\subsection{\textbf{Projection of Sequence Reads in LSH}}

We constructed the LSH family with bit sampling \cite{indyk1998approximate}. The normalized kmers frequency based feature vectors of sequence reads were first projected into $d$ dimensional vectors in $\{0,1\}^d$ space. Given an input vector $v$ and a random hyperplane defined by $r$, we let $h(v)=\{0,1\}$ based on $sgn(v\cdot{r})=\pm{1}$ that indicates on which side of the hyperplane $v$ lies. Each possible choice of $r$ defines a single function. Let $H$ be the set of all such functions. For any $h_i\in{H}$ and for any two data $x,y$ the probability that $x$ and $y$ \emph{agree} on $i^{th}$ positions of their respective $d$-length binary vector is
\begin{equation}
P[h_i(x)=h_i(y)]=1-\frac{distance(h_i(x),h_i(y))}{d} 
\end{equation}
Where \emph{distance} is the hamming distance and $d$ is the number of bits. Hence $H=\{h_1,h_2,...,h_d\}$ is a $(d_1,d_2,1-d_1/d,1-d2/d)$ sensitive LSH family. Both the random projection and hamming distance calculation is cheap and fast which makes this scheme appropriate for our purpose - fast partitioning of large scale genome sequences so that more expensive clustering can be done in parallel. Moreover, this projection and distance scheme is computationally inexpensive than another popular alternative for LSH known as MinHash \cite{broder1997resemblance}. MinHash provides $n!$ choices for hash functions in LSH family where $n$ is the total number of kgrams. Whereas our scheme generates only $d<<n!$ hash functions where $d$ can be easily estimated by sampling and validation based on 16S and metagenomic data.  

\subsection{\textbf{Sub-Clustering Inside Canopies}}
\label{sub-cluster}
We have used three recent and popular sequence clustering methods as the expensive clustering measure inside canopies in this study. UCLUST \cite{MARuclust}, SUMACLUST \cite{MARSumaclust} and SWARM \cite{MARSwarm2} were used for sub-clustering canopies. We also implemented and evaluated a LSH based Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) sequence clustering method as an accurate sub-clustering within canopies.

\subsection{\textbf{Merging results from Canopies}}

Each cluster (OTU) is represented by the Longest Common Subsequence of all member sequences. The final step of our proposed framework is to merge OTU representations generated by canopies. According to Canopy cluster algorithm a single data point may belong to multiple canopies as long as the soft threshold is met. As a result similar OTU representations may appear from multiple canopies. To eliminate redundancy we run UCLUST on the OTU representations. We also use Minimum Spanning Tree and Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) distance based clustering method to merge OTU representations.  
 
In the following Sections UCLUST, SUMACLUST, SWARM and MST with Canopy clustering approach are represented as CC$_{UCLUST}$, CC$_{SUMACLUST}$, CC$_{SWARM}$ and CC$_{MST}$ respectively where the term CC stands for Canopy Clustering. 

\section{Experimental Evaluation}
\label{sec:Experimental}

\subsection{\textbf{Dataset Description}}

%HR EDITS 

To evaluate the performance of our proposed approach we use previously published synthetic and real world sequence benchmarks \cite{MARopenDeNovo} which are publicly available\footnote{https://github.com/ekopylova/otu-clustering}. We used three synthetic 16S rRNA gene mock community datasets (Bokulich$_2$, Bokulich$_3$, and Bokulich$_6$) from Bokulich et. al. \cite{MARmockDatasetRef} and three real data sets: a 16S rRNA gene soil data set (Canadian Soil) \cite{MARcanadianSoil}, a 16S rRNA gene human data set (Body Sites) \cite{MARbodySites} and 18S rRNA gene soil data set (Global Soil) \cite{MARglobalSoil}. We have also used a whole metagenomic sequence dataset containing whole gut microbiome wide association study result of Liver Cirrhosis disease from \cite{qin2014alterations} to evaluate the performance of our approach on metagenomic sequence data. Key statistics and relevant information regarding these datasets are presented in Table \ref{table:finaltabledataset}.

\textbf{Synthetic Datasets:}

\subsubsection{\textit{Bokulich$_2$}}
This dataset was prepared using the 
Illumina TruSeq v2 paired--end library
preparation kit. It is a simulated 16S rRNA gene 
microbial community data set.
This 
dataset contains 19 taxonomic Families, 19 Genera, 22 Species 
and 22 Strains in total. This dataset can also be 
found in the QIIME database (identifier 1685).

\subsubsection{\textit{Bokulich$_3$}}
Similar to Bokulich$_2$ except that it was 
prepared with the 
TruSeq v1 paired-end library kit at 
Illumina Cambridge and is  also available in the 
QIIME database (identifier 1686).

\subsubsection{\textit{Bokulich$_6$}}
This  16S rRNA dataset 
was sequenced at Washington University School of Medicine and contains evenly distributed microbial communities. This dataset contains 13 taxonomic Families, 23 Genera, 44 Species and 48 Strains in total.

All these datasets from Bokulich et al. \cite{MARmockDatasetRef} are available at QIIME database\footnote{http://qiime.org/home\_static/dataFiles.html} under their respective ID's. Since, these are simulated datasets the taxonomic profile of microbial organisms within them are known.

\textbf{Real World Datasets:}

\subsubsection{Canadian Soil}
The Canadian Soil dataset\footnote{http://www.cm2bl.org/} contains genomic data of soil spanning from Arctic Tundra to Agricultural soil suitable for different agricultural products.  

\subsubsection{Body Sites}
This dataset contains composition of bacterial communities from up to 27 different body sites in healthy adults. A collection of 602 samples acquired from different body sites of human subjects are provided with meta-data.

\subsubsection{Global Soil}
The global soil data was taken from Ramirez et al. \cite{MARglobalSoil} which is a study of the below-ground diversity in New York City's Central Park.

\subsubsection{Liver Cirrhosis}
The Liver Cirrhosis dataset was taken from the study \cite{qin2014alterations} which is a whole gut microbiome wide association study of stool samples from 98 liver cirrhosis patients and 83 healthy controls to characterize the fecal microbial communities and their functional composition. In total, 860 Gb of high-quality sequence data was generated in this study. Because of the high volume of sequence reads in this dataset, we used random sampling for feasible clustering performance evaluations. Three million and thirty million sequence reads were randomly chosen from original dataset regardless of sample labels (disease or control). These two sampled datasets reflects clustering scalability with increasing size of metagenomic data.   


\subsection{\textbf{Evaluation Metrics}}

We evaluate the performance of our developed clustering approach using 
the following commonly used metrics that are used 
for the assessment of (i) outputs from clustering algorithms, (ii) biodiversity
within metagenome samples and (iii) computational run time. 


\subsubsection{\textit{Faith’s phylogenetic diversity metric (PD)}}
Faith’s phylogenetic diversity \cite{MARfaith1992conservation} combines all 
the branch lengths of phylogenetic tree as a measure of diversity. So, if a new 
OTU is found and it is closely related to another OTU in the sample, it will contribute to 
a small increase to the PD score. However, if a new OTU from different lineage is found then it will contribute to a large increase in the PD score.

\subsubsection{\textit{Shannon Entropy}}

Shannon-Wiener diversity index is defined as:

\begin{equation}
H={-} \sum_{i=1}^{s} \left( p_i\log_2p_i \right)
\end{equation}

where s is the number of OTUs and $p_i$ is the proportion of the community represented by OTU $i$. The Shannon index increases as both the richness and evenness of the community increase. The fact that the index incorporates both components of biodiversity can be seen as both a strength and a weakness. It is a strength because it provides a simple summary, but it is a weakness because it makes it difficult to compare communities that differ greatly in richness.


\subsubsection{\textit{Simpson's Index}}
Simpson’s index is defined as ${1-dominance}$ or

\begin{equation}
1 - \sum p_i^2
\end{equation}

where where $p_i$ is the proportion of the community represented by OTU $i$. Simpsonʼs index is based on the probability that any two individuals drawn at random from an infinitely large community belong to the same species. It measures \textit{evenness} of the community from 0 to 1. Higher value of this index implies higher similarity and relatively lower diversity of microorganisms within a sample.


\subsubsection{\textit{F-measure}}
In case of synthetic datasets, false-positive (FP; taxonomy/OTU exists in observed but not expected), false-negative
(FN; taxonomy/OTU exists in expected but not observed), and 
true-positive (TP; taxonomy/OTU exists in both observed and expected) measures were computed from 
cluster output and the ground truth which is the expected taxonomic composition. The following definitions were used:

\begin{equation}
precision = \frac{TP}{(TP + FP)}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
recall = \frac{TP}{(TP + FN)}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
F Score = \frac{2 \times precision \times recall}{(precision + recall)}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{\textit{Pearson Coefficient Correlation ($\rho$-value)}}
After getting Operational Taxonomic Units (OTU) from a clustering method we create a taxonomic profile at the Genus level. Pearson’s correlation coefficient was computed to measure the relatedness of taxonomic assignment between a pair of tools. Values range between -1 and 1, with -1 indicating a negative correlation, 0 indicating no correlation, and 1 indicating a positive correlation or strong relationship.

\subsection{\textbf{Parameter Settings}}
For kmers, the value of parameter k was set to 4. For Locality Sensitive Hashing the number of Hyper-planes (parameter $d$) was set to 150. For performance analysis and comparison we have chosen $T1=0.45$ and $T2=0.34$. We performed all the experiments on computers with Intel 5th generation Core i7 2.70GHz 64bit processor with 8 core CPUs and 12GB memory. Similarity identity of sub-clustering methods were set to default 97\%. For implementation we used Python 2.7.12 and QIIME \cite{MARQiime} version 1.9.0. Taxonomy for reported OTUs was assigned using the RDP Classifier \cite{MARRdp} against the 97\% representative databases for Greengenes \cite{MARGreen1} and Silva \cite{MARSilva} for methods used in this study. We used PyNast\footnote{http://biocore.github.io/pynast/} open source sequence aligner for aligning clustered output. 

\section{Results Discussion} 
\label{sec:Results}

\subsection{\textbf{Clustering Performance}}
Table \ref{table:performanceTable} shows the performance of  UCLUST, SUMACLUST and SWARM with their corresponding versions with CC clustering. Table \ref{table:performanceTable} compares F-scores and Pearson Correlation Coefficient ($\rho$). F-scores are only available for synthetic benchmarks since taxonomic profile for them is known as ground truth. Correlation values were generated based on taxonomic profiles at Genus level generated from outputs from clustering methods. From Table \ref{table:performanceTable} we can see that F-scores obtained from a clustering method and its corresponding Canopy clustering version are very similar and in some cases better. We see a higher F-score for Bokulich$_2$ benchmark from CC$_{SUMACLUST}$. CC$_{UCLUST}$ and CC$_{SWARM}$ provided same F-scores as their respective naive versions for Bokulich$_2$. For Bokulich$_3$ benchmark we observed higher F-scores for all Canopy clustering methods. Finally for Bokulich$_6$ benchmark F-scores of CC$_{UCLUST}$ and CC$_{SWARM}$ were improved comparing to respective naive versions.

For all benchmarks we observe strong correlations between taxonomic profiles at genus level. The highest correlation was observed for Bokulich$_6$ benchmark between UCLUST and CC$_{UCLUST}$ with 0.9831. CC$_{MST}$ provided relatively similar F-scores and high $\rho$ values indicating positive correlations of taxonomic outcomes with other methods. From observed F-scores and correlation values we can say that running a sequence clustering method with our proposed LSH based Canopy cluster framework can bring similar or better results.


\subsection{\textbf{Biodiversity Estimation}} Clustering metagenome sequences outputs OTUs that represent biodiversity contained in the samples from which data is collected. We compare the biodiversity represented by OTUs from naive methods and their respective Canopy clustering variations used in this study. Table \ref{table:bioDiversityTable} shows Faith’s phylogenetic diversity metric (PD), Shannon and Simpson index after clustering with different methods. These metrics are some of the popular Alpha Diversity metrics meaning that they measure species diversity in sites or habitats at a local scale. These metric values are generated per sample basis. Table \ref{table:bioDiversityTable} shows ranges of metric values in $[minimum-maximum]$ format provided by methods with and without Canopy clustering. Any sample of a dataset will take value from this range. These ranges may not be same since OTUs vary over clustering methods. But they should be similar for a method and it's Canopy counterpart. We can see from Table \ref{table:bioDiversityTable} that Canopy clustering based methods produce similar ranges of values as their naive counterparts. No significant changes in diversity metric values were observed which indicates that Canopy based approaches reproduce similar biodiversity while reducing run time.

\subsection{\textbf{Runtime Comparison}} Table \ref{table:Runtime} shows the run time in minutes of UCLUST, SUMACLUST, SWARM, MST and their respective versions with our proposed Canopy clustering pipeline. We see from Table \ref{table:Runtime} that CC$_{UCLUST}$ outperforms UCLUST for all datasets. The highest speed up for UCLUST was observed for Bokulich$_2$ dataset where CC$_{UCLUST}$ was 2.10 times faster than UCLUST. CC$_{SUMACLUST}$ outperforms SUMACLUST in most cases. Major improvement in run time was observed in large scale real world metagenome datasets specially Canadian Soil and Global Soil datasets. The highest speed-up for CC$_{SUMACLUST}$ was observed to be 7.70x for Global Soil dataset. We also see speedups for CC$_{SWARM}$ and CC$_{MST}$ from Table \ref{table:Runtime}. The highest speedups for CC$_{SWARM}$ and CC$_{MST}$ were 4.79x and 2.13x for Global Soil dataset which is the largest benchmark used in this study, respectively. From these observations we conclude that Canopy clustering not only reduces the run time of an expensive clustering method but also scales well for larger benchmark datasets comparing to the smaller ones.

\subsection{\textbf{Effect of Varying Number of Processors}}
Figure \ref{fig:bokulich_2}-\ref{fig:global_soil} shows the runtime of CC$_{UCLUST}$, CC$_{SUMACLUST}$, CC$_{SWARM}$ and CC$_{MST}$ on two largest benchmarks titled Bokulich$_2$ and Global Soil. We observe that increasing the number of processors reduces the total runtime. Steeper curves show reduction in runtime with increasing number of processors. Significant reductions in run time were observed CC$_{MST}$, CC$_{SUMACLUST}$ and CC$_{SUMACLUST}$ compared to CC$_{UCLUST}$.   

\subsection{\textbf{Sensitivity Analysis (Varying T1 and T2)}}
Figure \ref{fig:bokulich_2_T1}-\ref{fig:bokulich_2_T2} shows effect of varying $T1$ ($T2$ fixed at 0.34) and $T2$ ($T1$ fixed at 0.45) on F-scores for the largest synthetic dataset Bokulich$_2$. Reducing $T1$ leads to comparatively \textit{strict} soft-threshold which will reduce repetitions of instances in multiple canopies. For a fixed $T2$ this implies that lower $T1$ will yield better canopy assignment. From Figure \ref{fig:bokulich_2_T1} we can say that when $T1$'s range is in 0.4 to 0.6 our proposed approach provides better F-Scores. On the other hand, increasing $T2$ leads to comparatively \textit{relaxed} tight-threshold for canopies. As a result instances will be prematurely assigned to canopies without waiting for best match. From Figure \ref{fig:bokulich_2_T2} we can say that when $T2$'s range  is in 0.25 to 0.35 our proposed approach achieves better F-Scores. Lower $T2$ may lead to higher runtime since instances will continue to reappear until the $T2$ is met.                   


\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
\label{sec:Conclusion}

We developed a greedy approximate clustering process for any accurate and relatively expensive clustering on large scale metagenome datasets. Our approach takes advantage of the multi-core CPU systems by partitioning the large dataset with a fast and cheap pairwise distance measure and then deploying comparatively expensive clustering in parallel which considers only data points that are inside a partition. Our proposed approach scales well with large datasets and provide significant reduction in computation time. We demonstrate that our approach provides similar outcome in terms of biodiversity metrics, ground truth and taxonomic correlation with corresponding expensive clustering methods.
