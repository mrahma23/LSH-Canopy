1. Fix All Tables so that things are consistent:
---> Call Canopy\_UCLUST as CC\_UCLUST for example.

2. Results for CC\_MST (Minimum Spanning Tree?)

3. Results needed for whole metagenomic sequences. 

4. In text all references of Canopy\_ should be CC. 

5. Table IV -- Move back to the range for the diversity measures as you had before. Mean does not make sense given the variance of the samples. 

6. Figures 5 and 6 just choose the largest dataset you have so it will be just one figure with 2 subplots --one with T1 fixed and one with T2 fixed. 

7. Figure 4-- just show for 2 of the largest datasets only. 

8. Fig1 and Fig2 combine. Don't show things that are easy to discuss with text.  See Zeehasham's flowchar in MC-MinH paper. 

9. Great work. If you can get this done by Monday early morning that will help me.
